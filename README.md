# dwm-zerostatus
My fork of dwmstatus for dwm status2d

At this point it is extremely different from the original, so much so that it
deserves its own name.

# To-Do
* fix Now playing block - letting it run for too long causes crash
* display mute symbol in volume when muted
* volume icon changing based on volume percentage
* wifi icon changing based on percentage (color too?)
* Maybe temperature icon changing based on percentage and color change
